Hi there! I'm Mindy. Professionally, I'm an engineer turned product manager with a background in Computer Vision/AI/Robotics and a passion for social impact technology. Privately, I just like to make things. Anything from home automation, to furniture, to paintings, art, and design is fair game to me.

If you are looking for an overarching summary of my professional life, please check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mindyhng). If you'd here to peek at the human behind the resume, welcome to my little corner of the internet! You can [check out my projects](/projects), or [read the latest thoughts on my mind](/blog). Enjoy your stay, and I hope you learn something  while you're here. ðŸ‘‹
