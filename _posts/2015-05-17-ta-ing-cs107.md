This quarter I am a teaching assistant for Stanford&#8217;s Computer Organization and Systems course. This mainly meansÂ that my understanding of C, pointer math, gdb, valgrind, floating point, and ELF32 header files have increased about 5x. Also I have written so many code reviews for so many students my head is spinning (that may also be from the late nights doing code reviews). But teaching is a lot of fun! It&#8217;s very interesting to plan the best way leading lab, and super satisfying to debug and answer questions in office hours. I am so impressed with the students&#8217; progress, I don&#8217;t know how I ever got through that class 2 years ago.
